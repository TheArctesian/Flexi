# Contribute 

Thank you for showing interest. You can skip to how if you don't care about my opions. I am an opensource and free software advoacte and I feel like at this school there is no big opportunities for students to contribute to the community with code. I have opensourced this project and pushed the repo on the site because I feel that CIS needs to cultivate a more open source community and also because I hope for this project to be used after I leave (i graduate 2023). So please make some PR and talk to lagos or a teacher about maintaing the backend so this dosn't day and so we can all contribute to this as a community.

## How 
I am going to assume you know nothing. Git is a VCS used, created originally because Linus Torvalds hated the other option when creating Linux. Github is a site which hosts repositorys (think folders), it is the foundation of software development and open source software. There are github alt like gitlab and bitbucket for those who don't want their data hosted on a microsoft server.
