# Svelte

Welcome to front end development, Svelte it the one of the most modern web frameworks and I personally love it. I also think it is very beginner friendly and fun to write in.

consult the svelte docs for more info.

To run it on a dev server go into this folder on your terminal

```
cd Client
```

Then install the pkgs with

```
yarn install
```

Build the file with

```
yarn run build
```

and finally fun it with

```
yarn run dev --open
```

It will then show a page in your browser. When you edit the code and save you will see the updates show up live on your localhost:3000 site.

## Project structure

In the src folder:

- Routes
  contains the files for each page

- Components
  Contains all the other svelte components

- Lib
  Contains all the extra code and data needed to handle the website
