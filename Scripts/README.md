# Install scripts

I use a particular set of tools for this project. I have here 3 install scripts for different OS.

For all the commands replace OS with your OS and run it in the terminal like this:

```
sh os_install.sh
```

if that doesn't work

```
bash os_install.sh
```

if that doesn't work

```
sh os_install.sh
```

Please read through the sh file to check if you have the pkgs already. For example on mac I will install brew for you and node js which you can comment out with a `#` if your don't need it.

Note for _Windows_:

<p style="text-align: center;">I will not support your OS

There are many philosophical reason why I hate windows, however the ones relevant to use is the package management system.
Windows, does not have a operational pkg management system.

Though it is the devil if you are so apathetic and mal spirited as to not use a full linux desktop, for a developer you need to use WSL (windows subsystem for linux). watch this [video](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-install-wsl2-windows-10) so you can follow on, then use the ubuntu install script
