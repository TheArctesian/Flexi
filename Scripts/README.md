# Install scripts

I use a particular set of tools for this project. I have here 3 install scripts for different OS.

For all the command to run is:

```
sh os_install.sh
```

Please read through the sh file to check if you have the pkgs already. For example on mac I will install brew for you and node js which you can comment out with a `#` if your don't need it.

The OS I support are:

- Arch based distros (arch-install.sh)

  - Artix
  - Arch
  - Arco
  - Endeavour
  - Garuda
  - Manjaro
  - ...

- Debian based distros (debian-install.sh)
  - Debian
  - Duvean
  - Mint
  - Ubuntu (but if your running ubuntu pls just switch to mint or a arch based distro)
  - Deepin
  - Kali
  - Rasbian
  - ...
- Gentoo based distros (gentoo-install.sh)
  - gentoo
  - funtoo
  - pentoo
  - calculate
  - ... (but there rly isnt many other usable ones)
- Fedora based distros (redhat-install.sh)

  - rocky
  - centOS
  - fedora
  - redhat

- Mac (mac-install.sh)
  - Try linux
- Windows
  - Figure it out yourself, I refuse to support the disgusting bloatware/malware. If your on windows please just use wsl to do this at least. At rm -rf windows and install a proper OS. If your really insist then watch this [video](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-install-wsl2-windows-10) so you can follow on with the guide
